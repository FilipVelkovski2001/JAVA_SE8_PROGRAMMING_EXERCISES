# Java Inheritance

Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes; for example, the relationship between father and son. In Java, a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
The class that inherits the properties is known as the sub-class or the child class.

# Java Encapsulation 

Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
